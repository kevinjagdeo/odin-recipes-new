    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 oil</li>
        <li>1-2 fresh Thai bird chilies</li>
        <li>6-8 dried red chilies</li>
        <li>1 tbsp Sichuan peppercorns, powdered/ground</li>
        <li>3 tbsp ginger, minced</li>
        <li>3 tbsp garlic, minced</li>
        <li>8 oz ground pork</li>
        <li>1-2 tbsp spicy bean sauce</li>
        <li>2/3 cup low sodium chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 lb silken tofu</li>
        <li>1/4 cup water</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp cornstarch</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp sesame oil</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>1 scallion, finely chopped</li>

    </ul>
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>
    <ol>
        <li>First, we toast the chilies. If you have homemade toasted chili oil, you can skip this step. Heat your wok
            or a
            small saucepan over low heat. Add half of the oil and throw in the fresh and dried peppers. Stir
            occasionally
            and heat until fragrant, about 5 minutes, ensuring that the peppers don’t burn. Remove from heat and set
            aside.</li>
        <li>Heat the remaining half of the oil in your wok over medium heat. Add the ginger. After 1 minute, add the
            garlic. Fry for another minute, and then turn up the heat to high and add the ground pork. Break up the meat
            and fry it until it’s cooked through. Add your ground Sichuan peppercorns and stir for about 15-30 seconds,
            taking care to not let it burn, as it will turn bitter if it does. </li>
        <li>Add the spicy bean sauce to the mixture and stir it in well. Add the chicken broth to the wok and stir. Let
            this simmer for a minute or so. While that's happening, ready your tofu and combine the water and cornstarch
            in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Add the cornstarch mixture to your sauce and stir. Let it bubble away until the sauce starts to thicken. (If
            it gets too thick, splash in a little more water or chicken stock.)</li>
        <li>Then add your chili oil from before—peppers and all! If you are using homemade chili oil, ONLY use the
            standing oil, as it's likely that you have salted it and you only want the oil, not additional salt. Stir
            the oil into the sauce, and add the tofu. Use your spatula to gently toss the tofu in the sauce. Let
            everything cook for 3-5 minutes. Add the sesame oil and sugar (if using) along with the scallions and stir
            until the scallions are just wilted. </li>
        <li>Serve with a last sprinkle of Sichuan peppercorn powder as a garnish if desired.</li>
    </ol>
